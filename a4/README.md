## Assignment 4

Files for RISC-V assembler and interpreter.

- `RiscVInterpreter.java`: A working interpreter with a five-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back).
- `RiscVAssembler.java`: An assembler that converts `.asm` files to ELF binaries.
- Sample `.asm` files: `arithmetic.asm` (computes `f = (a + b) - (c + d)`) and `bubble_sort.asm` (sorts an array).
